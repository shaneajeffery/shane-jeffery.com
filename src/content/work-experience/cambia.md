## Main Notable Project: Page Builder & Content Management System

### Problem Statement

Similar to McKesson, Cambia faced challenges in effectively managing the content lifecycle, particularly in relation to the content driving member portals across three plans: Regence, Bridgespan Health, and Asurus. The imperative was to establish a system wherein content authors could seamlessly create and deploy content to production while maintaining its intended layout.

### Solution

The initial step involved determining the ideal platform for housing the content. Following insights from two content authors with previous experience in Contentful, a Proof of Concept (POC) was conducted, confirming its suitability for current and future requirements. Subsequently, collaborative efforts were directed towards developing a user interface (UI) abstraction layer atop Contentful's Headless Content Management System (CMS).

Subsequent to establishing the content infrastructure, the focus shifted towards structuring the content effectively for member portals. This necessitated the utilization of technologies such as React DND, Material UI, and bespoke logic to engineer a drag-and-drop page builder. This tool facilitated the creation of multi-column/row layouts employing curated content blocks.

### Result

The resultant solution empowered content authors to effect changes in production autonomously, eliminating the need for developer intervention. Moreover, the system obviated the necessity for new feature development, as content blocks could be generated within the UI abstraction layer, affording content authors the flexibility to construct pages accordingly.
