### Seven Years of Dormancy

In late 2017, I made the decision to discontinue operations with MaskedArmory.com, coinciding with the closure of KHAccounts.net. The absence of compelling financial incentives, coupled with heightened personal priorities, rendered the venture unsustainable at the time.

### Revisiting Seven Years Later: A Compelling Case

Despite its retirement, Masked Armory maintained a distinguished presence in its niche, and remarkably, the landscape of competition has remained largely unchanged. Presently, Safe Armory stands as the sole dominant force in the domain. The genesis of Masked Armory in 2010 was fueled by dissatisfaction with existing alternatives, which persisted over time. Now, with an industry still stagnated, the imperative to inject vitality through healthy competition is undeniable.

Furthermore, this revival is motivated purely by passion, devoid of any commercial aspirations. The project will be open-sourced as it nears Version 1, inviting participation from fellow developers within the community. This endeavor seeks to foster a sense of communal ownership within the RMT (Real Money Trading) community, providing stakeholders with a vested interest in its success.

### Strategic Approach

The initial steps have involved migrating the original codebase from its previous GitHub repository to a newly established one under my pertinent GitHub account.

In 2017, segregating the frontend, backend, and database into distinct services was deemed necessary. However, contemporary paradigms have shifted, rendering such compartmentalization obsolete. Hence, the plan now entails leveraging Remix with RSC (React Server Components), TailwindCSS, and Prisma (with the choice between Postgres or Mongo for the database yet to be finalized).

### Projected Timeline

The timeline for this endeavor remains indeterminate, as I embark on familiarizing myself with the Remix ecosystem from scratch. Nevertheless, with over eight years of experience in React and prior exposure to NextJS, proficiency acquisition is anticipated to be expedited.

Expectations regarding the release of Version 1 will be communicated within the coming weeks.

Stay tuned!
