        There aren't enough good things for me to say about Shane. He's an exemplary developer, architect, colleague, and friend. His passion for his work is evident in the quality of the work that he produces and his unwavering dedication to the people and teams he supports and collaborates with. In my time working with Shane, he not only helped produce new tools from scratch to alleviate significant inefficiencies in our tooling, but also advocated and spoke up for the teams effected so their concerns would be heard and addressed from the top-down. He did not sleep until he helped everyone in the process. I feel incredibly fortunate for being given the opportunity to work with Shane, and know that my sentiments will be shared with whomever is lucky enough to work with him next.

        Shane and I worked closely together overseeing numerous high impact, high priority projects over the last few years. His attention to detail, SME knowledge, and his commitment to excellence are only some of the many qualities he possesses.  

        &nbsp;

        His people first mindset and dedication to business deliverables is unmatched. He delivers on every commitment and goes above and beyond in everything he does - he’s an invaluable asset to any company and I am honored to have had to opportunity to learn beside him.

        I have had the pleasure of working closely with Shane as our team’s lead architect, and I cannot recommend him highly enough. His passion for his craft is contagious, infusing our team with energy and drive. Beyond his impressive technical skills, Shane stands out for his unwavering dedication to our collective success. What truly sets him apart is his kindness and patience, traits that have fostered a truly supportive and inclusive atmosphere within our team. Even in his own free time, Shane generously offered his expertise to tackle challenges head-on. It’s been a privilege to collaborate with him, and I am confident that anyone fortunate enough to work with Shane will witness firsthand his exceptional talent and character.

        Shane is a total joy to work with and incredibly prolific and knowledgeable. He made a big impact before I joined (I see his name everywhere in source control) and after I joined he moved on to make a huge impact on our content team. Not only that, but he's generous with his time, reasonable and very funny!

        Shane is one of the strongest and most dedicated lead engineers and lead architects I have ever met. He is a talented front-end and back-end developer and design architects of both large-scale and small scale systems. Outside of his technical talents, he stands by his team and is guided not only by an undeterred commitment to understanding and solving for every problem he faces, but by an unwavering dedication to mission. Shane is the kind of employee, co-worker, friend, engineer, and leader who not only delivers on his own commitments but makes every team he works with stronger, more hopeful, and more purposeful for his being there. He will be an asset to any organization.

        Shane is the most motivated and skillful frontend developer I've ever had the pleasure of working with. His ability to take extremely challenging problems in stride, and to orchestrate team members to accomplish goals in a tactful manner is invaluable to any team he's with. Shane's ability to communicate with everyone involved in a software project (stakeholders, other teams, senior and new developers), and his need to seek understanding made working with him fun, informative, and focused. I highly recommend him for any software development position - he will definitely exceed all expectations.

        Shane is a really talented and diligent engineer. Although we only got to work for a short amount of time at HP, I was able to pick up on a lot of React fundamentals with his guidance. 

        &nbsp;

        Along with being a skilled problem solver, he also displays great leadership skills. Within weeks of joining, Shane established himself as a crucial technical lead for the frontend and led a massive refactor effort in modernizing an older React application.

        &nbsp;

        I enjoyed working with Shane and I would definitely recommend him for any software engineering position.

        Shane came into our company and quickly organized the work needed to ensure customers had a good, reliable SSO connection. This work was new for our team, and the institutions with which we work have various strategies/platforms. Shane not only works hard to determine what is needed to connect with an institution, but he also provides assistance to those institutions that may not fully understand the process/requirements. He ensures there is good communication throughout the process, answers questions quickly -- and in an efficient, pointed way. 

        &nbsp;

        Shane was also able to read best ways to work within our company to lend support where needed. I enjoyed watching how he came in, observed how things were done, and then jumped in with his invaluable contributions. He organized the work in a way that ensured everyone on the team knew the status of a project at any point, and that we could easily communicate with customers in case of a security incident. This organization will live beyond his time with our company!

        &nbsp;

        I have enjoyed getting to know Shane. As a customer professional from a non-technical world, having Shane on the team gives me confidence that our customers are having technical issues addressed in a professional, timely and helpful way. Shane is collegial, supportive, and willing to do whatever it takes to support those customers, and other members of the team. I appreciated a comment he made when we interviewed him. If he doesn't know the answer, he will search until he finds it -- the question/problem is the challenge he enjoys pursuing. I see that at work in our company, to our benefit. A consummate problem solver, Shane is also a professional, supportive teammate.

        Well...this is tough. Having been with Shane for a short period of time, due to an entire development team layoff, I can only say that he has been an extremely valuable addition to our team. Through no fault of his own our company has been completely reorganized. Shane's position was incredibly represented by this young man. He was an integral part to our development team and fit our culture very well. It is a shame I will no longer be able to take advantage of his wit and his talent. He added an exceptional layer of expertise to our stack. If there is anything I can do to further his advancement I would be most honored to do so. Feel free to contact me and please consider Shane when looking for someone who is not only a tremendous individual, but a great source of technical knowledge, when technical knowledge is required.

        Shane joined the Treetop Commons engineering team when he took on a completely new and challengingly complex role of Identity Access Management engineer. His hard work ethic and diligent focus quickly had him navigating the cluttered and obscure identity management and SSO paths that had been sporadically set in the past. In just a month, he was working to clear them up, make more secure and efficient connections, and help all of us - engineers and customers - be more confident and satisfied with our products. Shane also served as point engineer, working directly with our large higher education clients and their IT departments, to integrate our product with their external SSO systems. Customers trusted him and his attentive responses and solutions. Shane’s energy, humor, and curiosity will be sorely missed at Treetop. I highly recommend him to any team driven to forging solutions and serving their customers.

        Shane is one of the most efficient and reliable team-leads I have worked with. Not only is he decisive and dynamic, he sets a high bar and delivers results. I was impressed with his ability to constantly learn and expand his skill set to contribute effectively to the team. And, of course, his down-to-earth attitude and commitment to get the job done! I have no doubt that Shane will be a valuable asset to any team requiring a member with a “can-do” attitude!

        I have never met someone as hardworking, disciplined, and perseverant as Shane. Shane is always willing to take on the most challenging tasks. He salvaged some of our product's most important features when others said it could not be done. It was a great pleasure to work with Shane. We would have been lost without him. I will gladly work with Shane again and I hope we cross paths again in the future.

        Shane is the hardest working technologist I have ever worked with. He was both the technical lead for our engineering team as well as our senior back-end developer. Our system had its share of growing pains — and I would often find Shane (voluntarily) working late into the night and on weekends to make sure that the system was up and running. He was always willing to do whatever it took to make sure we were always delivering value to our customers. I would welcome the opportunity to work with Shane again!

        Extremely committed to his work, Shane goes the extra mile with long hours, hard work, and a drive to fulfill business needs expediently. He's great at turning highly complex business problems into accomplish-able tasks, and seeing them through to solid solutions. Shane is always finding excellent ways to do things, works effortlessly across the entire stack, and always hits his mark. On top of that, he’s a great guy and a joy to work with, anyone would be lucky to have him!

        Without reservation, it is a pleasure to recommend Shane. My time working with Shane was limited, but in that time I realized just how skilled he is. His ability to look at requirements and assess the true nature of those requirements is admirable, but what sets Shane apart is his ability to deliver on those requirements and exceed expectations.

        Shane is possibly the hardest working developer I have ever had the pleasure to manage. His drive for results, and dedication to our company and team are beyond impressive. He is a proficient PHP developer who has made a profound impact on the quality of our code, and the efficiency of our development workflow. He also maintains a strong customer focus, and is quick to volunteer when there’s work to be done to make our customers happy.

        I collaborated with Shane during his time at Visions for Education when they were building their business model around GradPoint. I was impressed with his professionalism and engineering creativity. I observed him to complete difficult projects where he used multiple techniques, programming languages, and different web technologies, always keeping abreast of latest technology trends. He is able to navigate easily between technical and business domains while always being focused on solutions and user experience. He is a team player, gets along very easily with his colleagues, and is very personable. He would be an asset to any organization and has my deep professional respect.

        During the years that he worked for my company, Shane demonstrated great skill as a programmer and a keen ability to manage projects, solve problems, learn new skills, and communicate effectively with clients.

        Shane is an extremely talented programmer and a rare breed who lives and breathes code. During his time working with Visions in Education, Shane was the lead developer to help us integrate our home grown Student Information System Launchpad to Pearson's Gradpoint product using DLAP, PHP, and SAML technologies. I would highly recommend Shane as a top coder who is fearless when taking on new technologies head on.

        Shane is an asset to any DevOps team. His technical acumen and professional commitment are both impressive. During his time at OSU, he was able to support our unit with an enterprise-level identity management initiative while also improving our unit's back-end technical infrastructure. In addition to his technical contributions, Shane was a trusted member of my leadership team whose input had significant influence on our day-to-day operations.
